          <h2>About Cowserve</h2>
          <b>Cowserve</b> (also known as <b>Project Cowserve</b>) is a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software'>free and open-source</a>
          web server written in a free and open-source programming language, Python. It supports many features, including:
          <li>
          PHP support (if installed)
          </li><li>
          SQL databases
          </li><li>
          Servers at any port
          </li>
          <h2>Getting started</h2>
          <p>
          We can create a new "hello" folder, then add a hello.html to it, then add some HTML syntax to it.
          </p>
          <p>
          Then, if we go to <code>hello/hello.html</code>, our HTML syntax is shown. Going only to <code>hello</code>
          will just show a link to our <code>hello.html</code>. Cowserve by default displays a list of files
          in a folder if there is no <code>index.html</code>.
          </p>
